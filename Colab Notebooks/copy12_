Revised Budget\n","\n","### The awards committee of your Prepleaf asked for your assistance with a budget allocation problem they're facing. Originally, the committee planned to give N research grants this year. However, due to spending cutbacks, the budget was reduced to newBudget and now they need to reallocate the grants. The committee made a decision that they'd like to impact as few grant recipients as possible by applying a maximum cap on all grants. Every grant initially planned to be higher than cap will now be exactly cap. Grants less or equal to cap, obviously, won't be impacted.\n","\n","### Given an array grantsArray of the original grants and the reduced budget newBudget, write a function findGrantsCap that finds in the most efficient manner a cap such that the least number of recipients is impacted and that the new budget constraint is met (i.e. sum of the N reallocated grants equals to newBudget).\n","\n","\n"," Examples:\n","> 1.\n"," input:  grantsArray = [2, 100, 50, 120, 1000], newBudget = 190\n","\n"," output: new_cap = 47, \n"," new grants array = [2, 47, 47, 47, 47].
